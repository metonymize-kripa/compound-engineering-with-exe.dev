# Compound Engineering: Behavioral Rules

- **Persistence First:** Always assume this is a long-running project. Every unit of work must make the *next* unit easier.
- **The Skill Map:** If you solve a specific technical hurdle (e.g., a complex regex, a specific API quirk), you MUST save it to `docs/skills/`.
- **Atomic Commits:** Work in small, verifiable chunks.
- **Context Awareness:** Before starting any task, read the current state of `AGENTS.md` to understand your active workflows.
